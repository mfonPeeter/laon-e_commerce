# Laon E-Commerce

This is an E-Commerce website project I built using React, Tailwind CSS, Commerce js API, Stripe API and Firebase API. Below is an image from the Laon e-commerce site:

To get started with the project, simply clone the repo and then open your code editor and run the command `npm install` to install the packages. Then, run the command `npm start`
to run the app in development mode. It will open http://localhost:3000 to view the website in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.
